female,"Just a note to say that if you see one of your mates fitting from an overdose, don't just stand there and watch, get some help!!! Just towards the end of the Andy C set as I was walking out, I saw a guy having a seizure on the ground from an overdose, as his friends stood and watched not knowing what to do! I immediately went and got my boyfriend who is first aid trained and also the police. The police just kept trying to lift him off the floor and restrain him by his rucksack, but I pointed out the guy was in a fit still and was going BLUE from lack of oxygen. They tried to give CPR without checking he was breathing first??? He could've died. The police really didn't have a clue, so we took over and got his mouth opened, as he was biting his tongue with his teeth from the fit which was blocking his airways, squeezed his cheeks and pulled his tongue out and pressed it down to get the air in. He started breathing again after about 30 seconds and the colour started coming back to his face. We then had to flip him to the side as he sicked all over our hands. We waited for him to come round and the police eventually carried him off to see the medic. What I'm trying to say is that if you see something happening similar, don't wait, send one of your friends for help and check that your friends AIRWAYS ARE CLEAR!! Get their mouth open, get their tongue free, push it down, get the air into your friend. This guy was just lucky I was passing through. It was really scary, his girlfriend was mortified, but just don't stand around and watch!!!! It's not the way I wanted to end my awesome time after the Andy C set, but I'm hoping those involved are now ok and that this message might get out there."

Then on top of that, The Shuttles were an absolute nightmare.   Very poorly ran.   Expected better from Insomniac!   Needless to say,  we got married somewhere else."

male,Who's ready to hit the studio?
female,"Tips for next years edc. 1. If u leave the speedway at the same time as everyone else don't complain about how long the shuttle or car lines are. LEAVE EARLIER! If u don't mind waiting in long lines then fuck it stay till the end. 2. Just cause u have vip doesn't mean ur the only one. 100's of people have VIP as well so don't expect to get special treatment. 3. Don't buy tickets or drugs from strangers bring all ur shit from home.4. Don't complain about the heat incase u forgot we're in vegas it get hot here even at night.5. Shuttle lines weren't that bad this year atleast they were moving.6. The shuttle rides can be boring if u let them. Use this time to meet new people, play games, sing songs.7. If u see someone in need say something!8. Keep hydrated! 9. There's gonna be atleast one or two hip hop artist if u don't like it there other Dj's playing. (Didn't seen dj Khaled by the way) With that said my edc this year was dope aside from a few little things. Like my ankle twisting day one on the way to the speedway. I had a good edc"

Unless the car is certified by the city (has a CPCN # on their back bumper) it's illegal to pay strangers for rides to and from EDC.  These rides should be free of charge.  There's no guarantee on these people at all.  That's a major risk getting into a car with someone random like this.

You have multiple agencies here in town that are still offering good deals round trip.

female,"It's EDC Day. Just a reminder to everyone who chooses to party under the influence and finds themselves in need of care. The medical crew at EDC is so high end that they basically built a mini emergency room on site. If you need care, you will not be arrested for what you consume or for the age you are while you took it. You will not be kicked out of the festival. And, you won't have to pay for onsite treatment - even if you don't have insurance or are from out of the country.

If you feel dizzy, head-achey, nauseated, dry, or your mouth is sticky, you may be dehydrated or have heat exhaustion. Do not take this lightly - especially if you plan to go under the influence.

If you are unsure if you should go to medical, or need ANY kind of help, snag a Ground Control staff member in a purple shirt with angel wings on the back. They are there for you. 
And if you're having a hard time, the Oasis is not only there for you, but there are counselors there specifically so you can talk to someone in private.

Have fun and be safe :)"

male,"Hello everyone, I just wanted to share with y'all about my experience in edclv 2015 being a noob and never have gone to a rave or festival edc 15 was my first. I didn't come fully prepared, forgetting one of the most essential things to bring to a festival in a dessert which would be the water camel backpack, I did buy an insomniac refillable bottle but it was uncomfortable to carry along and also was empty very often. As I waited for a friend next to the merch booth some guy came up to me asking if I needed a water backpack and at first I thought he was joking but he handed it to me and he just skipped away maybe he was high as fuck idk but it's still an awesome thing to do. This of course made my day I was so happy because I knew I wouldn't overheat or have to worry about leaving the set midway. 
 Just wanted to share that because I partially feel like I want to thank him in a way with this post since I didn't thank him then and I want to remind you guys that being selfless goes a long way. Let's actually be PLUR. Not just just today or during EDC but carry along that attitude towards others anytime of the year!"

female,"Good evening, fellow EDC 2017 attenders! I am going to be attending EDC for my first time this year, and I happen to not have a hotel room set up. I'm posting this as a request for someone to graciously allow me to use their restroom for even just one of these days for a mere 15-20 minutes to shower and prepare for the day.

I am also driving myself to Vegas by myself. I have many friends attending EDC and can most likely provide me with a restroom to swiftly use for the three days I'm attending (Friday, Saturday & Sunday) but part of the experience in trying to engage in is socially interacting with completely random people and feeling a sense of community and support for one another. I can most likely find find a last resort, but I hope someone is kind enough to allow me that short time, and it would mean the world to me. And as of right now, I do not in fact have somewhere to do so.

Thank you for taking the time to read my post. I'll be arriving in Las Vegas within 10 hours, but I would appreciate an available restroom anytime after 7am at your convenience."

After weeks of emailing insomniac, trying out spots and routes and talking to drivers we finally we came up with the most efficient way to transport people to and from EDC with our party busses . Taxi and uber will be upwards of $100 to get into speedway and you will be paying to sit in a car in traffic . WE ARE DOING PARTY BUSSES . We have 3 pick up times . As of right now it's 3pm 6pm and 9pm . On the way back it till be 3am 5am and 7am . You can buy a 2 way or just a one way . Please don't be left without a ride because people will try to take advantage of you . We will be giving out wristbands out of our offices. We will be selling the busses on the strip as well so it's first come first serve . The busses are BYOB but we will provide water and snacks . The only rule for the bus is to have good vibes. One way ticket is $70 and both ways is $120 which is pretty cheap for a ride there in a party bus . 

Please send me a text with how many people in the group and which time you would like .

Also, if you guys are interested in doing the pool crawl or club crawl. They're also selling out fast
